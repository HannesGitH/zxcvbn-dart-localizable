# Zxcvbn-Dart

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/careapp-inc/zxcvbn-dart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/careapp-inc/zxcvbn-dart)

[`zxcvbn`](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) is a password strength estimator inspired by password crackers, developed by DropBox. This project is a Dart port of the original CoffeeScript, for use in Flutter and other Dart projects.

## Usage

Zxcvbn accepts a password input and returns a score from 0-4, giving an indication of the password strength.

```dart
import 'package:zxcvbn/zxcvbn.dart';

void main() {
  final zxcvbn = Zxcvbn();

  final result = zxcvbn.evaluate('P@ssw0rd');

  print('Password: ${result.password}');
  print('Score: ${result.score}');
  print(result.feedback.warning);
  for (final suggestion in result.feedback.suggestions) {
    print(suggestion);
  }
}
```

The `Result` object includes lots more information about the password strength. This project has the same feature set as the Official Zxcvbn, so check out their [documentation](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn#usage).

## Development

This project was created as a fork of DropBox's CoffeeScript Zxcvbn library for use in Dart. Note there is already an existing Dart implementation, [Xcvbnm](https://pub.dev/packages/xcvbnm). However, we found that Xcvbnm returned vastly different results compared to Zxcvbn official. Xcvbnm's readme also makes it clear the library is incomplete:

> Please note, that library did not port all functionality but is already used in production.

This project was started with the goals:

- Give exactly the same results for the same inputs as the CoffeeScript
- Port all tests from CoffeeScript
- Be as close to the original CoffeeScript as possible in order to aid implementing and debugging dart, as well as making it easier to bring upstream changes
- Hide the coffee-like implementation from users of this library, so from the outside it feels like Dart

As this is a close port of CoffeeScript, rather than a clean room implementation, the Dart code inside `src` is somewhat ugly and non-standard Dart in a lot of ways. However, keeping it close to CoffeeScript is seen as more important.

## Contributing

### Bugs

This library should give the exact same output for a password input as the official library. The official library can be tested [online](https://lowe.github.io/tryzxcvbn/). If this library gives a different result (`score`, or `guesses_log10`), please file a bug report, detailing the password input, user dictionaries (if used), and the expected result.

### API

While the internals of this library need to stay as close to the CoffeeScript as possible, we want this to be a nice library to use. Contributions that improve the API for users are welcome. The goal is to hide the internals as much as possible, giving a nice API from the outside.

### Upstream Changes

Zxcvbn hasn't been updated for several years, but that doesn't mean it won't ever see updates. We welcome contributions that bring over upstream changes - again, keeping the internal Dart code as close to the CoffeeScript as possible.

## Acknowledgements

- This project is a manual port of the official Zxcvbn CoffeeScript source code, and would not be possible without DropBox creating and open sourcing the library

- This project made use of Xcvbnm's source code to verify Dart ports, and a bit of Copy-Paste here and there to speed up porting. We thank the original authors of Xcvbnm.
